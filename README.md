# LLM University Code Implementation
Built and Deployed LLM idea generator app using streamlit


Welcome to the LLM University Code Implementation repository! This project showcases implementations of various machine learning and natural language processing concepts using Jupyter notebooks and Streamlit. It includes an interactive web application for generating startup ideas based on industry keywords, along with detailed notebooks covering fundamental ML and NLP techniques.

# Deployed Application

The project includes a live, deployed Streamlit app that serves as a startup idea generator. You can interact with the app here: [Startup Idea Generator](https://llmuniversitycodeimplementation-dcyvcmrx4b6edkwuey3vtl.streamlit.app/)

App Features:

- Enter an industry keyword to generate startup ideas.
- Adjust the number of ideas to generate (1â€“10).
- Customize creativity levels to tailor idea generation.

## **Below is a demonstration of the app's interface:**

# Repository Structure

### Folders and Files:

notebooks/

Contains Jupyter notebooks that explain and implement various machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Notebooks include:
- LLM_University_Building_a_Chatbot.ipynb
- LLM_University_Few_Shot_Classification.ipynb
- LLM_University_Text_Clustering.ipynb
- LLM_University_Semantic_Search.ipynb
- LLM_University_Text_Generation.ipynb
- LLM_University_Parameters_for_controlling_output.ipynb

These notebooks are a great resource for understanding fundamental concepts, experimentation, and hands-on practice.

llm_streamlit_deploy/

This folder contains the files required for deploying the Streamlit application:

- app.py: The main Streamlit app script.
- requirements.txt: Dependencies for running the app.

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/aljebraschool/llm_university_code_implementation.git
cd llm_university_code_implementation
```
2. Install Dependencies

For Jupyter Notebooks:For PyCharm and General Python Environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Streamlit App Locally
Navigate to the Streamlit app directory and run:

```bash
cd llm_streamlit_deploy
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will be available in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

4. Explore the Notebooks
Open the notebooks using Jupyter or your IDE of choice (e.g., PyCharm with Jupyter plugin).

# How to Use the Streamlit App
1. Open the deployed app [here](https://llmuniversitycodeimplementation-dcyvcmrx4b6edkwuey3vtl.streamlit.app/).
2. Enter an industry keyword (e.g., coding, education, healthcare).
3. Adjust the number of ideas and creativity slider to generate tailored results.
4. View the generated startup ideas in real-time!
